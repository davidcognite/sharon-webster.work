                        <p>This project reinforced the importance of adapting research methods to specific contexts and constraints. By being flexible and working collaboratively with stakeholders, we designed an approach that was quickly approved and delivered valuable insights.</p>

                        <p>Conducting research in authentic environments revealed insights that wouldn't have emerged in controlled lab settings. The interaction between users, technology, and environmental factors was crucial to understanding the complete user experience.</p>
