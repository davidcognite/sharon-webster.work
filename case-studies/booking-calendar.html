                    <div class="learnings-content">
                        <h3>Small Changes, Big Impact</h3>
                        <p>The most significant improvements came from relatively small interface changes focused on clarity and communication. Complex functionality didn't require complete redesign, just better explanation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mobile-First Approach Essential</h3>
                        <p>With the majority of users booking on mobile devices, designing for mobile constraints first led to clearer, more focused interactions that benefited all users regardless of device.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Error Prevention Beats Error Handling</h3>
                        <p>Preventing users from making invalid selections was far more effective than showing error messages after failed attempts. This approach reduced frustration and improved completion rates significantly.</p>
